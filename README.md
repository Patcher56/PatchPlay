<h1>PatchPlay</h1>

PatchPlay is a fast, simple and stable music player for Garry's Mod 13!

<h2>Why we recommend using PatchPlay?</h2>

<h3>Everybody wants music:</h3>
Since we have Garry's Mod we always dreamed of listening to music inside Garry's Mod synchronised with other players. With PatchPlay this is possible now!

<h3>Server and client side navigation</h3>
The Super-Admins of the server can decide what everybody should hear. At the moment only radio-streams are possible. If the client does not want to listen to this music, he can just use the private mode with his OWN streams. He can easily switch to server-mode at any time!

<h3>Simple but functional</h3>
Also we are pleased to keep the code as simple as possible, to prevent confusions or other similar things.
On the other hand we keep adding new functions to give you more freedom to control and more abilties to set things up like you whish to.

<h3>2 Frames for perfect control</h3>
The Frames are called<b>Stream-List, Custom URL</b>.

In the Custom URL Frame you can write any stream URL in, and the player tries to play it. You can also give the stream a name and save it for faster usage. Then, in the Stream-List frame you can choose from your saved streams and you can play them with one click!

<h3>Bug fixing</h3>
We try to keep PatchPlay as bugfree as possible.
If someone posts an error on GitHub or on Workshop, we try to fix the problem as soon as possible. But please have in mind, that we are students, so it could happen that the bugfix would take some time.

<h3>Modern Design</h3>
PatchPlay is not just a functional addon. No, it also looks very good. We gave PatchPlay a nice modern design, which makes it comfortable to use. The notifications are big and minimalistic.
If you don't like something on the design, you can post a comment on GitHub or on Workshop. Maybe you also have some ideas, which can improve the design.


<h2>Usage of PatchPlay:</h2>
